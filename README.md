# Movie Recommender System using RAG

This project is a movie recommendation chatbot that leverages OpenAI embeddings, Pinecone vector search, and LangChain to provide movie recommendations based on user input. The chatbot processes a dataset of movies, transforms them into embeddings, which are stored in a vector database which allows for more acurate and fast retrevial then most traditional methods. Because of the fast retreival, I was able to use a dataset a bit bigger then the specified length or even bigger if wanted. I believe that this is a more forward thinking approach and one that looks to the future of machine learning, and that is why I decided to levereage a RAG system over a TF-IDF system

## üìÇ Dataset

The project uses a _CSV file (imdb_movie_dataset.csv)_, which can also be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yusufdelikkaya/imdb-movie-dataset. The features included in the dataset are:
- Title
- Genre
- Description
- Director
- Actors
- Year
- Rating
- Metascore

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Create and Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv lumaa
source lumaa/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
lumaa\Scripts\activate    # Windows
```

### 2. Install Dependencies Activate the Virtual Environment

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up Environment Variables

(I have attached MY API keys that way the project is easy for you guys to run (I understand that this is horrible practice, but there is only about $3 worth of credits on the account as they are temporary keys that will be deleted after the project has been reviewed. I trust that the keys would'nt be abused as well), but you will need to create a .env file at the root directory and add) :

- PINECONE_API_KEY = "pcsk_5jRVqy_KMSsgNvdoujgzDxFbHULRx6JiMScHN9t95KswjU7g7qdfdWmpeUa4S8E4sfsHn5"
- PINECONE_API_ENV = "us-east-1-aws"
- OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-proj-YuRrwLegwEDAQSAZWNNTFYPnP4ll07VOTYWJRPNXBmSH69aXNP-08Pnu5ByUOzS5H3EbVkQp5qT3BlbkFJjvxU0jtYQvCGt_ptpxqC-\_AWD8yHu8bD2QdmP76aBMjJyTI0OGYt8a6Z0u16pGuGB6FxAtTpYA"

### 4. Run the final model

navigate into the model directory and run the Recommender_System.py file:

```bash
cd model
python3 Recommender_System.py

```

### 5. Querey Model

wait for model to prompt you and have fun!
